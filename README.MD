# PokeNet Server
Forked from [here](https://github.com/StrickenFromHistory/PocketMonstersOnline).

Old PokeNet server branch that I updated a year ago. Not using this anymore, or anything PokeNet related.

If you don't know, and as pointed [here](https://github.com/StrickenFromHistory/PocketMonstersOnline/issues/1), this code is
released under AGPLv3. My modification ARE ALSO released under the same license.

It was compiled with Java 8 and Eclipse.

State changes:
- Extended support with MySQL database driver (moved to static class afaik)
- Some warnings and other things are changes
- Fix registration
- Some error handling
